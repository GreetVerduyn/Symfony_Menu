== Make Website (Menu)

* Go in the terminal to the location you want it to be stored

 composer create-project symfony/skeleton Menu

* Go to the file and do following commands

 composer require make

 composer req twig

* Make first Controller

 php bin/console make:controller
 (Home Controller, route set to '/')

** add the line of code to the base.html.twig (template)

* add navigation bar (Bootstrap Navbar; copy paste the code in the body of base.html.twig)
Now I adapt the navbar:
** I rename the title of the navbar into Menu and instead of link, I will use Dishes

** the target link needs to be adapted also...
In the homeController you can find the route

I change it to the route of the Homepage
