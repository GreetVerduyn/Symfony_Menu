== Make Website (Menu)

* Go in the terminal to the location you want it to be stored

 composer create-project symfony/skeleton Menu

* Go to the file and do following commands

 composer require make

 composer req twig

* Make first Controller

 php bin/console make:controller
 (Home Controller, route set to '/')

* TEST SOME FUNCTIONALITIES

* add Bootstrap (Google search: bootstrap cdn)

** add the line of code to the base.html.twig (template)

image::src/images/image-2022-09-15-11-48-57-749.png[width=3000]

* add navigation bar (Bootstrap Navbar; copy paste the code in the body of base.html.twig)
Now I adapt the navbar:
** I rename the title of the navbar into Menu and instead of link, I will use Dishes

image::src/images/image-2022-09-15-14-12-03-260.png[width=3000]

** the target link needs to be adapted also...
In the homeController you can find the route

image::src/images/image-2022-09-15-14-10-50-380.png[width=500]

I change the route in the navbar into the route of the Homepage.
To adapt the link, I use the function 'path({{ 'nameOfRoute' }})'

To check how its works, I create a (temporary) second view (start) and link it in the navbar

* START WITH FREE TEMPLATE

Now I can get started with a free template.

** I download the website, remove all images en copy all files into the public folder of this project.

** I copy everything from the index.html and paste it into base.html.twig

** To acces the assets (CSS and images) I have to install assets by giving the command in the terminal.

 composer req asset

With this package I can specify all links of pass relative to folder public.
I adapt all the links:   <link href="{{ assets('THE LINK')}}">
and change the pass for the JavaScript files : <script src="{{assets('PASS')}}"></script>

** I add {%block body%} {%endblock%} between the header and the first section

I put the code from the first part into the home-template, and I adapt the ref in the navbar.

* install doctrine and set up a database

 composer req doctrine

 php bin/console doctrine:database:create

 php bin/console make entity
 php bin/console make:migration

Then I need to check the code in the Migrationfolder and execute the command

 php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate


* For maintainability and overview I create a separate controller for different pages of function or the web application.

 php bin/console make:controller

I call it DishController and create a function 'create'.
This function needs to use ManagerRegistry
To save the new dishes in the database, I need an Entity manager

image::src/images/image-2022-09-19-11-05-42-563.png[]

 use Doctrine\Persistence\ManagerRegistry;      !!!!

In the repository I can create queries to the entity (a few are automatically created)
This queries I can call in the controller

I adapt the index function into:

 #[Route('/', name: '_edit')]                                   // route = /dish/     name= app_dish_edit
 public function index(DishesRepository $dr): Response
 {
 $dishes = $dr->findAll();
 return $this->render('dish/index.html.twig', [
 'dish' => '$dishes',
 ]);
 }

In the index.html.twig of the dish template, I remove everything in the block body
and add a container with a table that includes the dishes

* I ad a price to the database

 php bin/console make:entity

(from the existing tale dishes)

 php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force

* now I create a form (name ends with 'type') and bound it to the entity 'Dishes'

 composer req form
 php bin/console make:form

** I adjust the create functin in the dishController into

image::src/images/image-2022-09-19-14-35-17-121.png[]

** I create a new view for dish (create.html.twig)
** add a submit button to the builder of the class DishType

image::src/images/image-2022-09-19-14-42-54-675.png[]

and add "form_theme: 'bootstrap_4_layout.html.twig'" into the twig.yaml, so all my form hava a bootstrap lay-out.
